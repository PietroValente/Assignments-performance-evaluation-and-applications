## Overview
The course addresses the problem of capacity planning of computer infrastructures. The topics considered are: performance modelling concepts and techniques, workload and traffic characterization, simulation of users behavior, measurement techniques and tools for end-to-end response time of web applications.

During the course I carried out some assignments that simulate real problems with the aim of calculating the performance indices. Together with these, the exam included the resolution and presentation of a final project.
