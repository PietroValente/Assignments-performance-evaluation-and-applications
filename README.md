## Overview
In the course of Performance Evaluation and Applications, I learned the techniques and tools to predict and optimize the performances of modern computer architectures, which are characterized by a high level of parallelism, sharing and dynamic allocation of computational and storage resources, centralized and distributed components, exascale dimensions of resources and users, and a high variability of requests. The course focused on both analytical and simulative techniques currently used in industrial and research environments. The course was based on the "Learning through Applications" approach, and we analyzed case studies in various domains, such as e-health, private and public clouds, autoscaling data centers, energy consumption reduction, machine learning, smart cities, and more.

Throughout the course, we addressed the problem of capacity planning of computer infrastructures, with a focus on performance modelling concepts and techniques, workload and traffic characterization, simulation of users' behavior, and measurement techniques and tools for end-to-end response time of web applications. I carried out various assignments that involved simulating real systems to calculate performance indices. The exam also included the resolution and presentation of a final project, which allowed me to apply the theoretical knowledge I had acquired during the course to a practical problem.
